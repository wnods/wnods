<h1 align="center"> Hey, I'm Wilson Oliveira.</h1>
<p align="left"> I'm an undergraduate Student in Geophysics focusing on Application of ML's and NN's in advancing geophysical research through the development of innovative methodologies and technologies for seismic data processing, well tie, well-log petrophysical predictions, and denoising and enhancement of seismic sections at the Federal University of ParÃ¡ (UFPA) on Petrophysics and Seismic Laboratory (LPS). I'm also a researcher at INCT of Criosfera and a ex-CNPq scholarship holder (Since 2023).

My interests include seismic processing and analysis, differentiable numerical simulators, machine learning, numerical modeling, automatic differentiation, and optimization theory.</p>
